                As your application grows, it helps to be more intentional about
                how your state is organized and how the data flows between your
                components. Redundant or duplicate state is a common source of
                bugs. In this chapter, youâ€™ll learn how to structure your state
                well, how to keep your state update logic maintainable, and how
                to share state between distant components.

                The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to
                add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which
                an object can inherit the properties and methods of another
                object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]]
                of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object

                3. What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
              </summary>
              <p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">
                The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to
                test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an
                important step in the development process, because if done
                correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be
                more difficult to find in later testing stages.

                Vue provides higher customizability and hence is easier to learn
                than Angular or React. Further, Vue has an overlap with Angular
                and React with respect to their functionality like the use of
                components. Hence, the transition to Vue from either of the two
                is an easy option.
